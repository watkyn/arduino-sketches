## Welcome

We (my kids and I) are using a sparkfun RedBoard Arduino and are including
pictures of the circuit along with each sketch.

Setup the circuit to match, and upload the sketch to try it out.


## Sketches

#### Ping Pong
We had fun learning some programming topics while implementing
an LED based ping pong game. Simple ping pong rules are observed, such as
switching server every 5 points, and you must win by two.


#### Egg incubator project
For this project you will need quite a bit of extra materials, such as a foam incubator
the DHT temp and humidity sensor, and some sort of A/C power switch to hook to the Arduino.


## Libraries

#### Copy or symlink the folders in libraries to the ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries folder
